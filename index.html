      <p>Precision Agriculture is the smart way of managing crops using various automated techniques and sensors to monitor variations in the fields and to deal with them using alternative strategies. This can be characterized as an effort to improve the results of practical farming. Precision Agriculture can be a method to intensify agriculture sustainably. The earth’s population is growing, population growth will be accompanied by an increase in food demand. To feed the growing population and to be able to continue to do so in the future, smart agricultural practices need to be applied. Water scarcity issues in Balochistan result in less water available for crops. Our proposed project includes crop health monitoring, smart irrigation, and pesticide detection. Smart irrigation system utilizes scarce water resources in a smarter way. Monitoring the crop using sensors deployed in the field provides valuable information to the farmers with the help of a web application so that they can manage their crops in a better way. Farmers can detect diseases in plants by leaf images taken with help of a smartphone. Data sources in our project are data collected by sensors and images taken with the help of a smartphone. We select NUST Balochistan Campus as our area of study. The proposed pilot project can be extended to be applied by farmers in Balochistan for their farms to make their agricultural practices smarter.

      <h1>Precision Agriculture </h1>
      <p>TPrecision Agriculture techniques help in improving crop yields and assisting management decisions using sensors and analysis tools. This is a new concept that is adopted throughout the world to increase production, resulting in a reduction of labor time ensuring effective management of crops and irrigation processes. Optimized inputs are provided to the field for better production. These techniques help farmers to know precisely what parameters are needed for a healthy crop, where these parameters are needed, and what amount at a particular instance of time. It involves the acquisition and processing of a large amount of data related to crop health. Multiple parameters are involved in plant health including water level, temperature, and others. This involves the collection of massive information from different parts of the field. All the data will be collected to produce useful recommendations. In the irrigation system, the collected data will determine how much water is required by the crops the next day. Sensors are important drivers in precision agriculture, which are multiple nodes deployed on the field to measure the physical parameters.
        A review was done depicting the applications of remote in precision agriculture and also the limitations of these systems were discussed. Also, the costs of these systems were too high [1]. A smart irrigation system was presented. Basically, the water pump was connected to a solar panel along with automatic water flow control based on readings from the soil moisture sensor. The proposed project saved the grid power but a large capital investment was required for this project [2]. Smart irrigation was done, and the whole system was controlled using a microcontroller, sensors were connected to the microcontroller when there is a change in humidity and temperature in the environment sensors will sense. In the proposed system there was no application interface, there can be easy to use interface for such a system [5]. In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based precision agriculture system, two modules were presented. The first one was a wireless sensor-based network to monitor the crop health status, the second one was in which remote sensing imagery was used to classify leaves as healthy and non-healthy. Hardware cost was an issue and it does not have a decision support system like an irrigation system it just gives an alert to the user about crop conditions [8]. Images of different plants were collected, extracted their features and applied different machine learning models on them, advantage of deep learning over machine learning is that in deep learning we do not need an explicit step of feature extraction while in machine learning feature extraction is involved in preprocessing stage [12]. Keeping in mind all mentioned limitations related to different techniques, we propose a feasible solution, which consists of three modules of crop health monitoring, smart irrigation, and disease detection. Crop health monitoring involves multiple sensors to get the real-time health status of the crop, another one is a smart irrigation system, that involves irrigation based on the sensor’s data, additionally, web application provide easy to use interface in which updates about the field conditions are given to the user. A less costly solution for disease detection is there, disease detection based on images taken with the help of a smartphone camera.

      <h2>Literature Review

      </h2>
      <p>Precision Agriculture is a method that introduces smart agriculture practices. In order to increase yield in the agriculture sector, precision agriculture applies the internet of things (IoT), information, and communication technology. It is an agricultural production system that decreases the negative impact on the environment and increases productivity, profitability, and efficiency. Precision agriculture uses spatial and temporal variability of soil properties, crop properties, and physiology to manage fields. There are various proposed solutions given for precision agriculture that involves crop health monitoring, smart irrigation, leaf disease detection, and other smart practices.
        [1], presented a review is given which includes the applications of remote sensing in precision agriculture and exploring the current uses and limitations of UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) in environmental monitoring and Precision Agriculture including camera and platform restrictions, UAS data processing issues, farmer participation, and aviation issues and also the costs of such systems were high. A smart irrigation system was proposed that consists of solar powered water pump along with an automatic water flow control using a moisture sensor. It is the proposed solution for the present energy crisis for Indian farmers. This system conserves electricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water by reducing water losses. Overall benefits of the system were high but the high capital investment is required to scale it [2].  Kodali, et al. [3], conducted a study in which they provides an elaboration of the basic principles of some of the sensors and their related specifications of a few commercial products. A Smart Rule-based Automated Fertilization and Irrigation System is implemented. Proposed a rule-based decision-making algorithm to monitor and control the food supply to the plant and the soil quality. A built-in alert system is also used to update the farmer using a text message. The system is developed and evaluated using real hardware [4]. 
        
        In [5], the purpose of this study is to provide information about automatic irrigation to plants which helps in saving money and water. The entire system is controlled using a microcontroller which is giving the interrupt signal to the motor. Temperature sensor and humidity sensor are connected to the microcontroller via a comparator, whenever there is a fluctuation in temperature and humidity of the environment, sensors sense the change in temperature give humidity, and give an interrupt signal to the micro-controller and thus the motor is activated, along with this buzzer is used to indicate that pump is on. In the proposed system there is no application interface given, there can be an easy-to-use web interface in which updates will be displayed about irrigation. Narvaez, et al. [6], this paper presented a survey of the state-of-the-art optical visible and near-visible spectrum sensors and techniques to estimate phenotyping variables from intensity, spectral, and volumetric measurements. The sensing methodologies are classified into three areas according to the purpose of the measurements: 1) plant structural characterization; 2) plant/fruit detection, and 3) plant physiology assessment. This paper also discusses the progress in data processing methods and the current open challenges in agricultural tasks in which the development of innovative sensing methodologies is required, such as pruning, fertilizer and pesticide management, crop monitoring, and automated harvesting.
        
        The authors reviewed all the factors that influence precision agriculture. This article describes the major endeavors of the past of precision agriculture. The noble intention behind this literature review and analogy is to figure out the gap between theoretical research and the actual needs of farmers. In order to find out the actual requirements for manuscripts the authors have conducted a questionnaire in the Rajasthan State of India. This gap analysis would be helpful for researchers to design an effective and efficient decision-support system for irrigation and fertilization can be designed [7]. Shafi, et al. [8] present a case study showing WSN-based precision agriculture systems. It is comprised of two modules. The first module is a wireless sensor network-based system to monitor real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low-altitude remote sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further classified as healthy and non-healthy crops. The research conducted faced the challenge of hardware cost and it lacked a support system as it only generates alerts to farmers if crops showed abnormal behavior. In [9], the RiceTalk project utilizes non-image IoT devices to detect rice blasts. Unlike the image-based plant disease detection approaches, our agriculture sensors generate non-image data that can be automatically trained and analyzed by the AI mechanism in real time. S. Harishankar, et al [10], this study employed three prediction models, namely CNN, SVM, and KNN, with different image processing methods to detect and classify apple plant leaves as healthy or diseased. These models were evaluated using the Kaggle New Plant Diseases database. This study aims to help farmers detect and prevent diseases from spreading. The proposed method provides recommendations for the appropriate solutions for each type of recognized plant disease based on the classification results. In research, Korkut, et al. [12] collected images of leaves of different plant species and extracted their features. Various machine learning models were employed on the extracted features. The evident advantage of deep learning over machine learning is that deep learning can be applied directly to raw data in various formats such as .csv, .jpg, etc. Machine learning, on the other hand, requires an additional step of pre-processing in the form of feature extraction.

      <p><mark>Methodology: Our proposed system includes the sensing system deployed in the field, sensors collect data from the field and forward it to the microcontroller. After processing by the microcontroller, it sends data to the gateway node. The gateway node forwards this data to the cloud server. The cloud server sends this data to the web application, which helps in communicating this data to the user. Smartphone camera takes images of the leaves and a classification model classifies them as healthy or non-healthy. Web application displays the results.
        The initial step in the smart irrigation system is to measure the soil characteristics and air temperature using soil and temperature sensors, and then wirelessly transmit those measurements using a wireless communication device. The main microcontroller part receives sensor data and takes decisions based on this data, the data from the database, and the day of irrigation it starts the irrigation order with details and sends these orders to a motor and drives units wirelessly. The system makes decisions on its own by deciding to stop irrigation if there is rain on the field. And for power efficiency, uses solar power system. So generally, the microcontroller system receives the sensors’ data and forwards that information to the motor to allow the water flow or not.
        The system uses the following sensors:
        1.	VH400 Soil moisture Sensor 
        2.	Temperature Sensor
        3.	Humidity Sensor
        4.	Rain Sensor
        5.	LMK Sensor ( to check water level)
        6.	pH Sensor
        
        Smartphone camera takes images of leaves and the classification model classifies them as healthy and non-healthy. Web application displays it. Disease detection starts with pre-processing and enhancing the input images, followed by segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. The noise in the background should be removed to enhance images and color space conversions, helping to properly focus on the region of attention of an image.
